    # Search Operations (s* prefix) - Aligned with neovim telescope patterns
    # Replaces default single-key search bindings with hierarchical approach

    # File search (replaces default "s")
    { on = ["s", "f"], run = "search --via=fd", desc = "Search files (fd)" },

    # Content search (replaces default "S")
    { on = ["s", "g"], run = "search --via=rg", desc = "Search grep content (ripgrep)" },

    # Resume search (new functionality matching neovim <leader>sr)
    { on = ["s", "r"], run = "escape --search", desc = "Search resume/cancel" },

    # In-buffer find (enhanced version of default "/")
    { on = ["s", "/"], run = "find --smart", desc = "Search in filenames" },
    { on = ["s", "?"], run = "find --previous --smart", desc = "Search previous in filenames" },

    # Search navigation (enhanced)
    # { on = ["s", "n"], run = "find_arrow", desc = "Search next match" },
    # { on = ["s", "N"], run = "find_arrow --previous", desc = "Search previous match" },
]

# Keep all other default keymaps unchanged for gradual adoption
# Original search keys are now available as fallbacks until muscle memory develops:
# - "s" still works for fd search (will show in help as deprecated)
# - "S" still works for ripgrep search
# - "/" still works for find
# - "n"/"N" still work for find navigation

# Note: This preserves all existing yazi functionality while adding
# hierarchical search commands that match neovim telescope patterns:
# - sf (search files) matches <leader>sf pattern
# - sg (search grep) matches <leader>sg pattern
# - sr (search resume) matches <leader>sr pattern
