description: Structured JSON with hierarchical key-value pairs and modern JavaScript object notation

Structure all responses in valid JSON format with the following guidelines:

# JSON Validity Requirements

- Use double quotes for all strings and property names
- Escape special characters per RFC 7159: quotation marks, backslashes, and control characters (backspace, form feed, newline, carriage return, tab) require backslash escaping
- Use null for undefined/empty values rather than omitting properties
- Numbers follow RFC 7159: base 10, optional minus, no leading zeros, optional fraction/exponent
- Use true/false for boolean values (lowercase, no quotes)
- Arrays use square brackets [] with comma separation
- Objects use curly braces {} with comma separation
- Trailing commas are not allowed in JSON (will cause parse errors)
- Comments are not native to JSON but can be included as "\_comment" properties
- Object names must be strings and should be unique within the object
- Default encoding is UTF-8 (RFC 7159 compliant)
- Whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) is allowed between tokens but not required

# Response Organization

- Use clear hierarchical structure with proper nesting
- Organize content into logical sections using JSON objects
- Include descriptive "\_comment" properties for context and explanations
- Use key-value pairs for structured information
- Employ JSON arrays for enumerated items
- Follow JSON syntax conventions strictly
- Use 2-space indentation for readability

# Output Structure

Format responses like configuration objects with sections such as:

- `task`: Brief description of what was accomplished
- `details`: Structured breakdown of implementation
- `files`: Array of files modified/created with descriptions
- `commands`: Array of commands that should be run
- `status`: Current state or completion status
- `next_steps`: Array of recommended follow-up actions (if applicable)
- `notes`: Array of additional context or important considerations

# Example Format

```json
{
  "task": "File modification completed",
  "status": "success",
  "details": {
    "action": "updated configuration",
    "target": "/path/to/file",
    "changes": 3
  },
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "/absolute/path/to/file.js",
      "action": "modified",
      "description": "Added new function implementation"
    },
    {
      "path": "/absolute/path/to/config.json",
      "action": "updated",
      "description": "Changed timeout settings"
    }
  ],
  "commands": ["npm test", "npm run lint"],
  "code_examples": {
    "implementation": "function validateInput(data) {\\n  if (!data || typeof data !== 'object') {\\n    throw new Error('Invalid input data');\\n  }\\n  return data;\\n}",
    "configuration": "{\\n  \\\"timeout\\\": 5000,\\n  \\\"retries\\\": 3,\\n  \\\"debug\\\": false\\n}"
  },
  "notes": [
    "All changes follow existing code patterns",
    "No breaking changes introduced"
  ],
  "_comment": "This structure provides clear organization while maintaining valid JSON syntax"
}
```

# Modern JSON Best Practices (2025)

- Use meaningful property names that clearly indicate their purpose
- Leverage nested objects for related data grouping
- Use arrays consistently for collections of similar items
- Include metadata properties prefixed with underscore (\_) for system information
- Maintain flat structure where possible to avoid deep nesting
- Use consistent data types across similar properties
- Include version information in API-style responses
- Consider using ISO 8601 format for timestamps
- Use camelCase for property names to align with JavaScript conventions
- Reference JSON Schema (https://json-schema.org/) for validation patterns when needed

# Key Principles

- Maintain parseable JSON syntax at all times
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Include relevant file paths as absolute paths
- Add explanatory "\_comment" properties where helpful
- Keep nesting logical and not overly deep
- Use appropriate JSON data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, null)
- Ensure all strings are properly quoted and escaped
- Follow RFC 7159 JSON specification requirements strictly
