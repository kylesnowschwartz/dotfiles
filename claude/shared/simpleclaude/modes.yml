# SimpleClaude Modes - Consolidated from 9 personas to 3 focused modes
# Adaptive modes that blend based on context rather than switch completely
#
# Note: The 'combines_personas' directive references personas defined in SuperClaude
# These personas (architect, analyzer, mentor, frontend, backend, refactorer, performance,
# qa, security) represent specialized expertise that each mode draws from

mode_selection:
  auto_detection:
    rules:
      - trigger: "Keywords like 'design', 'architecture', 'understand'"
        mode: "planner"

      - trigger: "Keywords like 'build', 'create', 'implement', 'fix'"
        mode: "implementer"

  blending:
    principle: "Modes blend naturally based on task needs"
    examples:
      - task: "Create secure API"
        blend: "Implementer (70%) + Tester (30%)"

      - task: "Debug performance issue"
        blend: "Planner (50%) + Implementer (50%)"

      - task: "Architecture review"
        blend: "Planner (60%) + Tester (40%)"
