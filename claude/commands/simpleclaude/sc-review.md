## Command Execution

**If "$ARGUMENTS" is empty**: Display usage suggestions and stop.  
**If "$ARGUMENTS" has content**: Think step-by-step, then execute.

Transforms: "$ARGUMENTS" into structured intent:

- What: [extracted-target]
- How: [detected-approach]
- Mode: [execution-mode]
- Agents: [auto-spawned sub-agents]

**Auto-Spawning:** Spawns specialized sub-agents for parallel task execution.

Comprehensive review router that transforms natural language into structured analysis for security, performance, architecture, and code quality assessment.

### Semantic Transformations

```
"strictly review the authentication module" →
  What: authentication module security and quality
  How: zero-tolerance comprehensive analysis
  Mode: planner

"check security vulnerabilities in payment" →
  What: payment system security weaknesses
  How: OWASP top 10 vulnerability scan
  Mode: implementer

"review performance bottlenecks" →
  What: system performance analysis
  How: profiling and optimization recommendations
  Mode: implementer

"test coverage analysis for API" →
  What: API test suite completeness
  How: coverage gaps and test scenario validation
  Mode: tester
```

Examples:

- `/sc-review authentication module` - Comprehensive security and quality review
- `/sc-review performance bottlenecks` - Performance analysis with optimization
- `/sc-review test coverage gaps` - Test suite analysis and improvements
- `/sc-review architecture patterns` - Design pattern and structure evaluation

**Context Detection:** Review request analysis → Focus areas identification → Review approach → Multiple concerns detection → Sub-agent spawning

## Core Workflows

**Planner:** Sub-agents → Define review scope → Identify risk areas → Create review strategy → Generate checklists **Implementer:** Sub-agents → Execute review → Analyze code quality → Generate feedback → Provide recommendations **Tester:** Sub-agents → Validate functionality → Check test coverage → Identify edge cases → Verify compliance
