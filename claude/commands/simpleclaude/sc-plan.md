# sc-plan: Strategic Planning and Analysis

**Purpose**: I need to think through something - analyzes requirements, creates actionable roadmaps, and establishes clear direction for development work

## Agent Orchestration and Deployment Strategy

**Efficiency First:** Handle tasks directly when possible. Use agents only when genuinely needed for:

- Multi-step coordination requiring handoffs
- Specialized domain expertise beyond general capability
- Parallel work streams with interdependencies
- Complex analysis requiring multiple perspectives
- Operations that produce verbose intermediate output

**Direct Agent Rules (ALWAYS delegate these):**

- **Documentation lookups** → Use `context7-documentation-specialist` (fallback: `repo-documentation-finder`)
- **Test execution** → Use `test-runner`
- **Web searches** → Use `web-search-researcher`
- **Multi-file analysis (10+ files)** → Use `context-analyzer`

**Available Agents:**

- `context-analyzer` - Maps project structure, patterns, and architecture
- `context7-documentation-specialist` - Fetches library/framework documentation
- `repo-documentation-finder` - Finds examples from GitHub repositories
- `test-runner` - Executes tests and analyzes failures
- `web-search-researcher` - Searches web for current information

**Context Preservation:**

- **Keep only**: user request, actionable recommendations, code changes, summary, next steps
- **Discard**: intermediate outputs, full docs, verbose logs, exploratory reads

**Processing Pipeline**: Parse → Classify → Validate → Route → Execute → Synthesize

## Intent Recognition and Semantic Transformation

This command interprets natural language requests that express the intent: "I need to think through something" - planning, analysis, strategy, roadmap creation, or architectural decision-making.

**Command Execution:**

**Empty "${arguments}"**: Display usage suggestions → stop
**Has content**: Parse intent → apply strategy → route execution

**Intent Processing:** Extract intent → Apply strategy matrix → Validate → Execute

**Strategy Matrix:**

| Condition | Direct Handling     | Agent Required                 |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Task Type | Simple, single-step | See "Direct Agent Rules" above |
| Domain    | Single, familiar    | Multi-tech, unknown            |
| Context   | Available locally   | External research needed       |
| Output    | Concise, focused    | Verbose, needs filtering       |

Transforms: "${arguments}" into structured execution:

- Intent: [recognized-user-intent]
- Approach: [direct/agent with reasoning]
- Agents: [none OR minimal-viable-set]

### Intent Recognition Examples

<example>
<input>${arguments} = "How should I approach adding real-time notifications to this app?"</input>
<intent>Architecture planning for real-time notifications feature</intent>
<approach>Direct analysis + agent research for best practices</approach>
<agents>web-search-researcher (per Direct Agent Rules)</agents>
<output>Structured plan with technology recommendations and implementation phases</output>
</example>

<example>
<input>${arguments} = "I need to plan the migration from React 16 to React 18"</input>
<intent>Technology migration strategy and roadmap</intent>
<approach>Documentation research + codebase analysis + migration planning</approach>
<agents>context7-documentation-specialist (per Direct Agent Rules), context-analyzer if 10+ files</agents>
<output>Phased migration plan with breaking changes, testing strategy, and timeline</output>
</example>
