## Command Execution

Executes immediately. Natural language controls behavior. Transforms: "$ARGUMENTS" into structured intent:

- What: [extracted-target]
- How: [detected-approach]
- Mode: [execution-mode]

### Semantic Transformations

[Main command description - explains how natural language is transformed into structured actions]

```
"[natural language example]" →
  What: [specific target extracted]
  How: [approach/method detected]
  Mode: [detected modes]

"[another example]" →
  What: [different target]
  How: [different approach]
  Mode: [different modes]
```

Examples:

- `/[command] [natural language]` - [What it does]
- `/[command] [different natural language]` - [Different behavior]
- `/[command] [compound natural language]` - [Blended modes]

**Intelligent Context Detection:** Analyzes request intent | Identifies scope automatically | Chooses optimal approach | Evidence-based modifications | Detects modes from natural language patterns

## Core Workflows

**[Workflow 1]:** [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3] → [Result]

**[Workflow 2]:** [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3] → [Result]
