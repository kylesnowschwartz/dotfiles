   ```

2. **For each best practice integration:**

   ```
   "Adding [technique] here because:
   - Current gap: [what's missing]
   - Technique benefit: [how it helps]
   - Implementation: [specific way to add it]"
   ```

3. **For architecture selection:**

   ```
   "This prompt is best suited for [pattern] because:
