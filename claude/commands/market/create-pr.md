# Open a pull request using the provided PR template
Analyze the changes in the codebase, create a github PR description that follows the template below, and then use this description to create a draft pull request.

Follow these guidelines for the description:

1. Use clear, concise language
2. Write in plain English
3. Maintain a semi-formal to casual toneâ€”professional but not overly formal
4. Focus on core changes, omitting minor side changes
5. Ensure each core change is clearly linked to the problem it's solving

Use the following template for the pull request description in @.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, or use the below template:

```md
## Jira issue
<!-- Insert a link to the Jira ticket if you are aware of one. If not, ignore this section -->
## Context
<!-- Your code and specs may seem self-explanatory to you, but your reviewer hasn't been thinking about the problem you're solving for as long as you have. Add a link to the Trello Card (if relevant). -->

## Changes
<!--Provide a detailed explanation of the changes you have made, files changed etc. Include the reasons behind these changes. Link any related issues. Discuss the impact of your changes on the project. This might include effects on performance, new dependencies, or changes in behaviour. Categorise changes in to groups as appropriate. -->
