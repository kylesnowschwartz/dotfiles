Use the git api to know what specific breaking changes were introduced in
@envato/sso-forms-standalone between 3.0.1 and 3.4.1. That will answer your
second question. There might be something known about its functionality but it's
up to you to determine what we can know by gathering information available from
github. We could even clone the repo if truly necessary. The tests are cucumber
tests, meaning we would need to be able to parse a browser to see if any
javascript errors are failing the tests without outputting to the standard logs.
If you need assistance, you should ask me to help.
