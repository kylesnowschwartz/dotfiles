 # Working Agreement

This playbook keeps our collaboration smooth and predictable. Start each session by checking the “Quick Start” so the essentials are top of mind, then dive into the sections below when you need detail.

**Quick Start**
- Plan your approach and get buy-in before touching code (CDP-001).
- Confirm APIs and run linters/tests after meaningful changes (CDP-002, CDP-003).
- Keep solutions simple, commits conventional, and branches tidy (CQS-004, CQS-006).

<SLICE>
SLICE: Build software in vertical slices
•   Stable dependencies: Point slices only at equal-or-more-stable neighbors (Stable Dependencies Principle).
•   Local change: Keep UI, logic, data, and integration for a feature together so changes stay inside one slice (high cohesion / Common Closure Principle).
•   Information hiding: Encapsulate volatile design choices behind the slice’s interface (Parnas).
•   Cohesive units: Depend on the slice’s public API or not at all — no half-layer imports, no leaking internals (Common Reuse Principle).
•   Encapsulated domains: Shape slices around domain boundaries that drive both modeling and deployment, not just folder structure (DDD).

<CORE-DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES>
  CDP-001 - Plan First: Present your step-by-step plan for approval before coding

  CDP-002 - Respect APIs: Confirm current APIs, use user-specified libraries, and collaborate in debugging issues rather than giving up

  CDP-003 - Lint And Test: Run linters and tests after significant changes to catch errors early

  CDP-004 - Explain Why: Use clear names, small functions, modular files, and comments that explain 'why' (not the 'what')

  CDP-005 - No Big Rewrites: Avoid large-scale rewrites unless explicitly asked

  CDP-006 - Diagnose Systematically: When blocked, isolate the root cause systematically and collaboratively with the User, instead of random trial-and-error

  CDP-007 - Skip Emojis: Omit emojis in code, comments, documentation, or communication unless explicitly requested

  CDP-008 - Trust But Verify: Verify user claims that contradict yours before declaring them correct

</CORE-DEVELOPMENT-PRINCIPLES>


<CODE-QUALITY-STANDARDS>
  CQS-001 - Clarify Requirements: If requirements are vague ask clarifying questions or propose a smaller first step

  CQS-002 - Honor Linters: Adhere to project-defined formatting and lint rules, fix checks before committing

  CQS-003 - Branch Cleanly: Branch from `main`, name branches descriptively, link PRs to issues, and prefer rebasing over merge commits unless instructed otherwise

  CQS-004 - Conventional Commits: Use conventional commit prefixes (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `style:`, `test:`) in present-tense active voice; keep commits small and focused

  CQS-005 - Fail Fast: Fail fast with explicit errors, craft minimal reproducible examples, employ temporary verbose logging, and clean logs before merging

  CQS-006 - Keep Solutions Simple: Follow KISS and YAGNI principles; prefer obvious, well-documented solutions over cleverness; minimize external dependencies; document public interfaces

</CODE-QUALITY-STANDARDS>

<PROJECT-MANAGEMENT>
  PM-001 - Quality First: Do not concern yourself with ROI, timelines, time or effort estimations, or other traditional measurements; focus on quality over arbitrary constraints

  PM-002 - Ask For Installs: Immediately stop and ask the User to help install packages rather than giving up or switching to inferior alternatives

  PM-003 - Push Safely: Use `git push` primarily; use `git push --force-with-lease` only after merges, rebases, or commit amendments

  PM-004 - Commit Clearly: Use `git commit -m` to commit changes

  PM-005 - Stage Selectively: use `git add <file1> <file2>` or `git add -u` never `git add -A`

  PM-006 - Respect Hooks: NEVER use the flag `--no-verify` to bypass commit hooks

</PROJECT-MANAGEMENT>

<CONFIGURATION>
  CFG-001 - SSH Workflow: Use SSH URLs for remotes, fork via `gh repo fork owner/repo --clone=false`, create PRs via `gh pr create --repo owner/repo --head username:branch`

  CFG-002 - Follow CLI Guidelines: When writing shell scripts follow the CLI Guidelines: `https://github.com/cli-guidelines/cli-guidelines`

</CONFIGURATION>

<TOOLING-TIPS-TRICKS>
  TTT-01 - WebFetch with r.jina.ai: When using the WebFetch tool prepend urls with r.jina.ai/ to convert a URL to LLM-friendly input, e.g. `https://r.jina.ai/https://zsh.sourceforge.io`

  TTT-02 - Directory Tree: View directory structure with `eza --tree --level DEPTH`
